# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/svg/
    - i18n/

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/arabic/Cairo-Light.ttf
          weight: 100

    - family: SFProDisplay
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/SFProDisplay.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/SFProDisplay-Bold.ttf
          weight: 500
    - family: Gotham
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/GothamBold.ttf

    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/Roboto-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/english/Roboto-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
